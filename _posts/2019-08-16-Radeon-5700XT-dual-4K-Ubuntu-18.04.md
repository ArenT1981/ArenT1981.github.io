Graphics hardware and driver support gets ever better under Linux. The AMD Radeon 5700XT Navi archictecture card has only just come out, but AMD were good enough to provide a launch day driver for Ubuntu 18.04 based distros, before the driver makes it into the mainline kernel this autumn. My experiences with it thus far have been overwhelmingly  positive.  

I decided to make a [short video](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k8Jc4HyOlY) on my experiences with the new Radeon 5700XT under Linux Ubuntu 18.04, and also took the opportunity to share a few thoughts on the current state of dual-monitor support in KDE Plasma and Cinnamon DE.

I've yet to give it a heavy-duty test (e.g. serious gaming), but can confirm that is working brilliantly with full hardware acceleration on a dual 4K monitor setup with the current official AMD release-day drivers. Since my real intended use of this computer is as a powerful workstation/workhorse (as opposed to a gaming rig), so far it has proven ideal.
